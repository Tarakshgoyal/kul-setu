# Life Story Feature Implementation

## 🎉 Feature Overview

Added a **Life Story** section to person profiles where individuals can write about themselves, share important life experiences, achievements, and memorable moments with their family.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Database Schema**
**File**: `kul-setu-backend/app.py`

Created `life_stories` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS life_stories (
    story_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    story_text TEXT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES family_members(person_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
CREATE INDEX idx_life_stories ON life_stories(person_id)
```

**Key Features**:
- One story per person (UNIQUE constraint)
- Auto-updates `last_updated` timestamp
- Cascading delete when person is removed
- Indexed for fast queries

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints**

}
```

**Empty State**:
```json
{
  "storyId": null,
  "personId": "P001",

}
```

  personName?: string;
}
```

## 📊 Example Data

### Sample Life Story
```
I was born in a small village in Punjab in 1950. My childhood was filled with 
helping my father in the fields and playing with my siblings.

In 1972, I graduated from Delhi University with a degree in Engineering. This 
was a proud moment for our family as I was the first to attend university.

I married my beloved wife in 1975, and we were blessed with three wonderful 
children. Our family values of hard work, honesty, and education have been 
passed down through generations.

Throughout my career as a civil engineer, I contributed to building several 
important infrastructure projects. But my greatest achievement is the loving 
family we've raised.

Now retired, I enjoy spending time with my grandchildren and sharing stories 
of our family's rich heritage. I hope this family tree preserves our history 
for future generations.
